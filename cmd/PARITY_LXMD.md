# Parity: python/LXMF/Utilities/lxmd.py

# TODO

- Port full CLI/config handling (flags, config defaults, example config generation).
- Port daemon/service behavior (logging, file paths, identities, storage layout).
- Port router wiring (delivery identity setup, propagation node setup, announce/peer sync paths).
- Port control commands (peer sync/unpeer/stats requests).
- Port periodic jobs, signal handling, and graceful shutdown.
